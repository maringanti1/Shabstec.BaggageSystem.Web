            Shabstec’s Bagnition platform has been designed to meet the IATA 1755 standard baggage operational processes and associated messaging standards. This highly configurable baggage logistics capability has been designed using over 100-man years of industry expertise to ensure that the baggage operations can be planned, executed, and optimised so that the airport exceeds its airlines partner expectations.

            The platform will also allow world class baggage systems vendors to co-exist within an airport’s Baggage eco system protecting its future capital investments.

            The Bagnition platform moves away from bespoke BHS interfaces by introducing highly simplified technologies that rely on well-established IT industry API standards. In the interim, the platform can still interface to legacy protocols and still utilise its underlying standards-based interfaces.

            The Bagnition platform is entirely driven by its reference data configuration. This configuration is available to privileged airport users to view and modify to suit operational needs.



            This very open architecture means that airport’s have a self-service capability in determining the baggage system configuration, its operating rules, and processes.

            The Bagnition software architecture has been designed in a modular fashion that allows engineers to modify and test existing logic without impact to other modules. New modules of functionality such as bespoke interfaces and business logic can easily be incorporated into the software architecture.



            The principal design philosophy is to ensure that all rules and system parameters can be configured to meet the business requirements of each airport and terminal. This sophisticated design provides airport operators with the maximum flexibility in choosing the operational strategy that suits their requirement.



            This applies to all the major HLC functions including but not limited to sortation exception processing, Hold Baggage Screening, reporting, Operator Interface, Baggage Reconciliation, Early Bag Store, Batch Building etc.
